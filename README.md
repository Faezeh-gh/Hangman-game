# Hangman-game
hangman game code

At first we import random dictionary which help our code to choose one of choices by itself and then add it as selected_word . 

We write our code under hangman_play function. 

Words is a list of choices. 

guesses is a list of letters which we guess. 

In while loop, we code how to show a word after user guesses. 

in line , we alarm user the error if there was any. 

If the letter that user guesses was right we show it in output, but if it wasn't a right guess we should decrease the number of tries.
